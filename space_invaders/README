# Space Invaders

## Overview
This is a **Space Invaders** clone created using **Python** and **Pygame**. The game features classic mechanics, including player movement, shooting, alien waves, win/lose conditions, and buttons for replaying or quitting.

## Features
- **Player Controls:** Move left and right, and shoot bullets to destroy aliens.
- **Alien Movement:** Aliens move as a group, drop down after hitting screen edges, and shoot bullets at the player.
- **Win Condition:** Destroy all aliens to win.
- **Lose Condition:** Get hit by an alien bullet to lose.
- **Restart and Quit Buttons:** Easily replay the game or exit directly from the end screen.

## Gameplay Instructions
1. Use **Left Arrow (←)** and **Right Arrow (→)** keys to move.
2. Press **Spacebar** to shoot bullets.
3. Destroy all aliens to win the game.
4. Avoid alien bullets—getting hit ends the game.
5. When the game ends, click **Replay** to restart or **Quit** to exit.
